! To install it, tweak to preference, then symlink or copy it to ~/.Xresources.
! Run `xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources` after installing, or making any changes to it.

! Enable UTF-8 (or you can ensure luit is installed, and auto-detect locale
! with `xterm*locale: true`; or just invoke `uxterm` instead of `xterm`)
xterm*locale: UTF-8

! Make the Alt/Option key behave like in other terminals, sending ^[ escape
! instead of acting as a modifier to let 8-bit characters be typed
XTerm.vt100.metaSendsEscape: true

! Choose a nicer font
! Use `fc-list :scalable=true:spacing=mono: family` to find out available fonts
